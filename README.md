To run the code, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps:

Copy the code into a file named server.js.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where server.js is located.
Run the command npm install express ejs oidc-provider to install the required dependencies.
Run the command node server.js to start the server.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the login page.
Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.
